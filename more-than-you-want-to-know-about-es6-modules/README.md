Abstract:

> ES6 Modules have been standardized and many have already started using them. They have a lot of benefits over CommonJS, AMD, and Globals.
>
> Unfortunately, there are many ways to deal with modules with this new syntax and it can be a bit confusing. In this talk, we'll explore the different ways you can use the new syntax and when you'd use the different methods. We'll also investigate what's going on at a high level. Buckle up for a firehose of ES6 information.
